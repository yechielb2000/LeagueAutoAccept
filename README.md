LeagueAutoAccept
=============
### So...
_I finally made a script that can actually help me_ 

### How it works?
_The script scans the desktop screen and waits for a specific image.
When it's recognizes the image it clicks on the image 
That's it._ ðŸ˜„

### How can i use it?
_I added a file called autoAccept.exe so you guys can run it as well !!_
